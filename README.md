#Battle Pong

This game is a twist on the classic game Pong. The twist is that the players can earn bullets to shoot the opposing player.

How is the bullet gained
--
The bullet is earned when the player hits the ball 2 times during a run, so if the ball goes out then the player will not
receive a bullet. When a player earns a point they also earn a bullet

The engine
--
The game will be created in C# by using a framework called [monogame](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame) which is an open source port of Microsofts XNA. The physics will be very basic and not include things like rotation.

Graphics
--
The game does not require any complex graphical work, all the sprites are colours resized to form the shapes.

Sound
--
The sound effects are very minimal, simple beeps when the ball is hit or a shot is fired.
