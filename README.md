#Battle Pong

This game is a twist on the classic game Pong. The twist is that the players can earn bullets to shoot the opposing player.

How is the bullet gained
--
The bullet is earned when the player hits the ball 2 times during a run, so if the ball goes out then the player will not
receive a bullet. When a player earns a point they also earn a bullet
